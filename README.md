GUtilitiesAPI is a reworking of [GUtilities](https://github.com/gu-on/GUtilities/), where the backend and frontend concerns have been separated. Additionally, Mac and Linux support is now provided. 

## Installation guide

Clone the repository and submodules:

    git clone --recursive --shallow-submodules https://github.com/gu-on/GUtilitiesAPI.git

GUtilitiesAPI is based on [ak5k's reaper-sdk-vscode template](https://github.com/ak5k/reaper-sdk-vscode), which includes instructions for getting set up on the various supported platforms. 

`gu_main.cpp` shouldn't be edited manually as it is automatically generated by `apigen.py`, which runs during the build process. It writes the code necessary to export the functions declared in `gu_api.hpp`. The `apigen.py` parses naively, expecting `//` comments followed by the function declaration (it also ignores #includes and blank lines). 

### Requirements:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.21 or newer
- C++17 compiler (MSVC on Windows)
- Python 3.6
